<h2>Summary</h2>

    <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
    <p>
        This site will contain information about local st geroge courses and information about 
        those courses such as website links, emails, and phone numbers. It will also display 
        average handicaps and difficulty of courses. You'll be able to look up reviews from patrons,
        and club recommendations depending on the hole of each course.
    </p>
    <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
    <p>
        Most of the content will either be taken from google, or created by me. I don't like the style
        of AI art so I will not be utilizing it.
    </p>
    <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
    <p>
        It's tailored to local golfers in the city, and cna be a helpful caddy replacment when golfing alone.
    </p>
    <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
    <p>
        When golfing alone, it can be intimidating trying to look for good courses around you and also 
        learning what clubs are appropriate for certain distances at certain courses. Caddies fill this 
        role for most, but when alone you don't have those caddies.
    </p>
    <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
    <p>
        First find local courses and the important information attached for those. Also being able to enter in
        reccomendations on what Club they used on a certain hole or reviews on local courses directly on the website.
    </p>
    <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
    <p>
        The goal is to just make golf less intimiadting for new players and being a good start/gateway into the sport.
